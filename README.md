# Use

Pull in all data :smile:

Do this first :pray:

```bash
ruby main.rb new
```

Now you can run `recent` without making api calls :rocket:

Get the latest 8 results for each contest

```bash
ruby main.rb recent
```

# Be nice

Don't slam the api. I would just call `new` every few days. Keep the data fresh, api calls low :boat:
